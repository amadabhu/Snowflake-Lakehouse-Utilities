# Snowflake_data_ingest
A generalized set of utilities for developing a data warehouse in Snowflake using AWS S3 as a primary staging environment. The AWS folder contains boiler plate code I developed to be reusable 
data ingestion functions. The SQL_queries contain queries I wrote as part of an ETL pipeline ingesting Refinitiv data. These queries are just examples; that need to be replaced with your own use case specific queries.
